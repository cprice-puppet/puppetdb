  # We need to be able to issue an HTTPS request to the PuppetDB server,
  # and we need to do it using Puppet's SSL config/certificates for
  # authentication.  Unfortunately, the "right" method to use for
  # accomplishing this is the `#http_request` method in the class
  # `Puppet::Indirector::REST`.  This is the method that has the most
  # complete and useful error handling for SSL errors.  Unfortunately,
  # this class is pretty much impossible to use unless you're writing an
  # Indirector terminus.
  #
  # To compound the issue, our Puppet::Util::Puppetdb module is designed
  # to be used as a mix-in for our PuppetDB indirector termini.  It
  # provides them the very useful `#submit_command` method, but it relies
  # on the existence of an `#http_post` method (defined in
  # `Puppet::Indirector::Rest`, as mentioned above) in order to work
  # properly.
  #
  # So... this class exists to provide a workaround implementation of
  # `#http_post`.  The underlying problem should be fixed in Puppet
  # 3.x with the resolution of ticket #15975 / pull request #1040.
  # However, for backward compatibility, we're stuck with this crappy
  # hack until that version of Puppet is our oldest supported version. We
  # should make it a point to clean this up as soon as possible after
  # that point in time.
